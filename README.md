# Electroporation-CGmem-MachineLearning
The repository contains the codes used for training machine learning models (random forest, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron neural network) to predict the location of pores formed by electric field in coarse-grained Martini membranes. 
The results are being prepared for publication. 

The codes have been developed by Xinru Tang and Fangwei Zhao.
